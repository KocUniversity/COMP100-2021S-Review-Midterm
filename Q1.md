Let's say you have been given the task of creating a poll over political preferences of a group of people. Unlike existing polls, you are asked to model the uncertainty as well. In your poll, you do not ask people to choose their political view but ask them to assign a probability over the given choices. For simplicity, there are five choices representing dominant ideologies: Conservative, Democrat, Liberal, Bystander, and Other. The probability over these five choices must sum to 1. For example, a person can choose to be 10% Conservative, 70% Democrat and 20% Liberal. Then, all the other choices should be 0 for that person. 

You will implement a solution in 3 parts. First you will implement part 1 in the `part1and2` function, then you will modify the `part1and2` function in part 2, and finally you will implement part 3 in the `part3` function. The parts of the code you need to modify in the code are also explained through the comments in the template.

1. **TLDR of votes**
First, you will take a simplistic approach. If a person's dominant choice is greater than a given threshold, e.g. 0.5, then you will assume that they belong to that political view. For example, with threshold 0.5, someone voting 

`[(0.1, 'Conservative'), (0.7, 'Democrat'), (0.2, 'Liberal'), (0.0, 'Bystander'), (0.0, 'Other')]` 

will be considered as the highest probability choice, i.e. "Democrat" in that case. If the highest probability is not higher than the threshold, then the choice will be automatically converted to "Bystander". If there are two views which has the same highest probability greater than the threshold, then pick the one which comes the first in the list. 

For a dataset of voters, your goal is to summarize the trend in the votes by finding the ratio of each category in the dataset. Given the dataset and a threshold, write a function that returns the result over the given dataset as a list of tuples.

Note: The dataset given to you is a List of List of Tuples. Each tuple consists of an integer and a string, signifying that person's likelihood of voting for that choice, and the name of the choice. Your return value should be a list of tuples. An example:

```
threshold = 0.5

Dataset elements and their simplified choices:
[(0.0, 'Conservative'), (0.6, 'Democrat'), (0.3, 'Liberal'), (0.0, 'Bystander'), (0.1, 'Other')] -> Democrat
[(0.8, 'Conservative'), (0.1, 'Democrat'), (0.0, 'Liberal'), (0.0, 'Bystander'), (0.1, 'Other')] -> Conservative
[(0.7, 'Liberal'), (0.3, 'Bystander'), (0.0, 'Conservative'), (0.0, 'Democrat'), (0.0, 'Other')] -> Liberal
[(0.9, 'Conservative'), (0.0, 'Democrat'), (0.0, 'Other'), (0.0, 'Liberal'), (0.1, 'Bystander')] -> Conservative
[(1.0, 'Democrat'), (0.0, 'Liberal'), (0.0, 'Conservative'), (0.0, 'Bystander'), (0.0, 'Other')] -> Democrat
[(0.4, 'Conservative'), (0.6, 'Democrat'), (0.0, 'Liberal'), (0.0, 'Bystander'), (0.0, 'Other')] -> Democrat
[(0.3, 'Bystander'), (0.4, 'Conservative'), (0.3, 'Democrat'), (0.0, 'Liberal'), (0.0, 'Other')] -> Bystander
[(0.9, 'Liberal'),, (0.0, 'Conservative'), (0.1, 'Democrat'), (0.0, 'Bystander'), (0.0, 'Other')] -> Liberal
[(0.7, 'Conservative'), (0.0, 'Democrat'), (0.0, 'Liberal'), (0.3, 'Bystander'), (0.0, 'Other')] -> Conservative
[(0.0, 'Conservative'), (0.0, 'Democrat'), (0.0, 'Liberal'), (0.0, 'Bystander'), (1.0, 'Other')] -> Other
```

According to this dataset, there are 10 voters and 3 of them are democrats, 3 of them are conservatives, 2 liberals, 1 other, and 1 bystander. Then you should return:

`[(0.3, 'Conservative'), (0.3, 'Democrat'), (0.2, 'Liberal'), (0.1, 'Bystander'), (0.1, 'Other')]`

2. **Can you be more specific?**

Let's say, for the choice "Other", voters are asked to specify their view. They can choose "Other" and specify their political view as "Anarchist", for example. In that case, first find all the unique views in the dataset and recreate the summary of trends in the first question by replacing the choice "Other" with a list of unique views specificed by the voters and their corresponding percentages.

```
[(0.0, 'Conservative'), (0.6, 'Democrat'), (0.3, 'Liberal'), (0.0, 'Bystander'), (0.1, 'Anarchist')]
[(0.8, 'Conservative'), (0.1, 'Democrat'), (0.0, 'Liberal'), (0.0, 'Bystander'), (0.1, 'Authoritarian')]
[(0.7, 'Liberal'), (0.3, 'Bystander'), (0.0, 'Conservative'), (0.0, 'Democrat'), (0.0, 'Socialist')]
[(0.9, 'Conservative'), (0.0, 'Democrat'), (0.0, 'Socialist'), (0.0, 'Liberal'), (0.1, 'Bystander')]
[(0.0, 'Democrat'), (0.0, 'Liberal'), (0.0, 'Conservative'), (0.0, 'Bystander'), (1.0, 'Anarchist')]
[(0.4, 'Conservative'), (0.6, 'Democrat'), (0.0, 'Liberal'), (0.0, 'Bystander'), (0.0, 'Socialist')]
[(0.3, 'Bystander'), (0.4, 'Conservative'), (0.3, 'Democrat'), (0.0, 'Liberal'), (0.0, 'Anarchist')]
[(0.9, 'Liberal'),, (0.0, 'Conservative'), (0.1, 'Democrat'), (0.0, 'Bystander'), (0.0, 'Communist')]
[(0.7, 'Conservative'), (0.0, 'Democrat'), (0.0, 'Liberal'), (0.3, 'Bystander'), (0.0, 'Communist')]
[(0.0, 'Conservative'), (0.0, 'Democrat'), (0.0, 'Liberal'), (0.0, 'Bystander'), (1.0, 'Socialist')]
```

According to this dataset, there are 10 voters: 3 conservative, 2 democrat,  2 liberal, 1 socialist, 1 anarchist and 1 bystander. Then you should return:
`[(0.3, 'Conservative'), (0.2, 'Democrat'), (0.2, 'Liberal'), (0.1, 'Anarchist'), (0.1, 'Bystander'), (0.1, 'Socialist')]` 


3. **In an uncertain world**
We live in an uncertain world, and it's hard to make one-out-of-n kind of choices. That's why we asked the voters to assign probabilites over their views. Let's use these probabilities to create more informative summaries with some statistics. For each political view, find the mean and the standard deviation (std) of the votes for that view across all the samples in the dataset. 

You can compute the sample mean `x_mean` and sample std `x_std` of samples `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n`  by using the following formula:

```
x_mean = (1/n) * (x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n)
x_var = (1/(n-1)) * ((x_1-x_mean)^2 + (x_2-x_mean)^2 + ... + (x_n-x_mean)^2)
x_std = x_var ^ 0.5
```
As an example, for the dataset:

```
[(0.35, 'Democrat'), (0.15, 'Conservative'), (0.35, 'Liberal'), (0.15, 'Bystander'), (0.0, 'Authoritarian')]
[(0.25, 'Bystander'), (0.65, 'Democrat'), (0.0, 'Conservative'), (0.0, 'Liberal'), (0.05, 'Anarchist')]
[(0.3, 'Anarchist'), (0.7, 'Conservative'), (0.0, 'Bystander'), (0.0, 'Democrat'), (0.0, 'Liberal')]
[(0.2, 'Bystander'), (0.25, 'Authoritarian'), (0.1, 'Democrat'), (0.2, 'Conservative'), (0.15, 'Liberal')]
[(0.55, 'Authoritarian'), (0.3, 'Democrat'), (0.05, 'Liberal'), (0.0, 'Conservative'), (0.1, 'Bystander')]
```
You should return:
```
Means of votes:
[(0.28, 'Democrat'), (0.21000000000000002, 'Conservative'), (0.11000000000000001, 'Liberal'), (0.14, 'Bystander'), (0.16, 'Authoritarian'), (0.06999999999999999, 'Anarchist')]

Standard deviations of votes:
[(0.25149552679918585, 'Democrat'), (0.28809720581775866, 'Conservative'), (0.14747881203752625, 'Liberal'), (0.09617692030835673, 'Bystander'), (0.21552262062252306, 'Authoritarian'), (0.11543396380615194, 'Anarchist')]
