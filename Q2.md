1. Write a recursive function P for computing the i'th number in the sequence of numbers below, according to this recursive formula:

> P(0) = 1
> P(1) = 0
> P(2) = 0

> for i > 2, P(i) = P(i-2) + P(i-3)

> (1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 16, 21, 28, 37, 49, ...)

2. Let's define a function f on a number as the number of times we need to apply addition on the digits of that number before we reach a single digit.

> f(67) = 2

> because 6+7 = 13 and 1+3 = 4

> f(48196) = 3

> because 4+8+1+9+6 = 28 and 2+8 = 10 and 1+0=1

Write a recursive function to implement f.
